# List Malicious Activities

## Query Information

#### Description
This query combines multiple malicious activities that have been performed by a compromised device into one query. This query can be used to get a quick overview if more malicious activities have been performed on a device. The data that is queries does mostly not trigger an incident itself. The data that is included in the query:
- ASR Triggers
- SmartScreen Events
- Antivirus Detections
- Tampering Detections
- Exploit Guard Triggers
- AMSI Events

In order for this query to succesfully execute the CompromisedDevice needs to be changed to the compromised device you want to investigate.
