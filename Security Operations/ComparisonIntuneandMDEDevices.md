# Comparison between devices in Intune and MDE

## Query Information

#### Description
This query lists the devices that are onboarded in Intune and classifies them based on the status of Defender For Endpoint. You can select your own *SearchPeriod* in this query. The MDE data is based on a process activities seen in the search window, if that is the case then the device is classified as *MDE Onboarded*. This can help determine which devices have not yet been onboarded to MDE.
