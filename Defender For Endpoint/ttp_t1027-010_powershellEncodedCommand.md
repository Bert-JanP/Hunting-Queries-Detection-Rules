#### Description
Detection opportunity 4: PowerShell -encodedcommand switch

We also observed at least one of these adversaries abusing the shortened -encoded PowerShell command switch to encode PowerShell commands. This is another common bit of tradecraft. The following should help detect and hunt for the behaviour.

#### Risk
FIN7, ZLoader, and FakeBat have been observed performing this behaviour in recent intrusions. Adversaries may encode commands to evade defenses.
