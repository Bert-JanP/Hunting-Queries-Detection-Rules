# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

This page includes the mapping of KQL queries to the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework. The framework is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

This section only includes references to queries that can be mapped in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework. Reconnaissance and Resource Development are out of scope.
