# List Device Isolations

## Query Information

### Description
This query lists all the device isolation activities that have been performed by Defender For Endpoint. It is good practice to review those once every x period. The query extracts multiple events from the isolation action, ssuch as which device is isolated, what isolation comment has been used and the type of isolation that has been executed.
