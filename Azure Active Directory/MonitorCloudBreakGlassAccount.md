# Detect when login is performed using a specified account (Cloud break glass account)

## Query Information

#### Description
It is best practice to have break glass accounts, which are excluded from all conditional access policies. To monitor all login activities under a specified account, this Detection Rule can be used. If any activity is performed using the specified account, an alert will be generated.

#### Risk
If an attacker could get access to a break glass account, this account could be used to bypass all conditional access rules, and get unrestricted access to the environment.
