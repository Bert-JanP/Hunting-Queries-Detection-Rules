| Technique ID | Title    | Link    |

#### Description
This query detects discovery events that have been performed by a user at risk, this is done based on the subset DiscoveryEvents. You can add other items to the list if you feel the need to do so, because the list is currently limited. If you think additions are needed please raise a pull request. 

The discovery events are related to downloading group members and getting tenant information, which would be a logical step for an attacker if he gained access to your Azure tenant. 

#### Risk
A user at risk that also performs discovery events is more likely to be compromised. Investigate the useraccount in more detail and disable the user if malicious activity is confirmed.
