# The art of Knowing Your SIEM & XDR Data

This learning section was part of the Demo for ExpertsLive Netherlands 2024.

Session Title: The art of knowing your SIEM & XDR data

Session summary:
The always-increasing amount of data that security professionals deal with on a daily basis can be challenging. Questions such as 'Do I have this evidence?' and 'Where can I find this data?' can be difficult to answer. This session will answer these questions by discussing the tables you have and the (subtypes of) data included in those tables. This session will explore how you can gather the most value from your data in Sentinel & Defender For XDR with (a little bit of) KQL magic.

Security professionals often query their data to enrich incidents, hunt for suspicious activities or build new detections. By diving deeper into the context of the available data sources we will discover new detection and enrichment potentials, enabling us to discover the data within the data (such as Operations and ActionTypes). I will begin with a complete overview of all the different categories of data you have, before diving into the individual tables and their subtypes.

Knowing the ingested SIEM & XDR data helps security professionals to work more effectively because they are aware of what they have and where that is located. Furthermore, it allows you to get more out of the data due to the discovery of new data types.

Right audience: Blue/Purple Teamers, Threat Hunters, Detection Engineers, Security Engineers, SOC Analysts and Incident Responders.
