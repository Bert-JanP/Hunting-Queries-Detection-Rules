# KQL-MISP
This folder is a KQL MISP implementation. The goal of this folder is to share queries which implement MISP feeds which can be used for detection, threat hunting or enrichment of incidents. No additional infrastructure or sources are needed besides an environment in which you can run KQL. This implementation can be used in Sentinel, Defender For Endpoint and other Log Analytics sources that fit your needs. 

MISP is a "*A threat intelligence platform for sharing, storing and correlating Indicators of Compromise of targeted attacks, threat intelligence, financial fraud information, vulnerability information or even counter-terrorism information.*" [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/).

The architecture used is shown below, where this folder provides the pulling of the data from MISP and translates that information into a KQL query.

Before you start implementing this solution think about your needs and the value that you want to get out of MISP. This solution offers a limited implementation in comparison to other MISP implementations (see [Other implementations](#Other-implementations)). If you want to implement a subset of the MISP feeds, only query on specific tables or have some fun with queries than this is the solution for you!

# Implementation
The queries in this folder are divided into two categories:
- [Sentinel (& Log Analytics)](./Sentinel/)
- [Defender For Endpoint](./Defender%20For%20Endpoint/)

The files in each folder represent the queries that can be used to leverage a MISP feed, the query can be copied an be used to create a detection on to hunt for specific activities. The reason why there are two different categories is the difference between the KQL syntax in Sentinel and MDE and the different tables that to search for IOCs. 

# MISP For KQL
The MISP queries in this repository are standardised to provide the best results. This is explained with the [Abuse.CH Malware Bazaar MD5 Feed](./Defender%20For%20Endpoint/MISP-MD5-AbuseCH-MalwareMD5.txt) as showed below. First the content is collected using the [externaldata()](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/externaldata-operator?pivots=azuredataexplorer) function. Then the results are validated, in this case is the content a MD5 hash as expected? This is done similarly for different IOC categories such as IP addresses. Then the validated content is used to search the DeviceEvents for the MD5 hash, if a malicious hash is found the results will be returned. 

```
let MISPFeed = externaldata(MD5: string)[@"https://bazaar.abuse.ch/export/txt/md5/recent"] with (format="txt", ignoreFirstRecord=True);
let MD5Regex = '[a-f0-9]{32}';
let MaliciousMD5 = materialize (
          MISPFeed 
          | where MD5 matches regex MD5Regex
          | distinct MD5
          );
DeviceFileEvents
| where MD5 has_any (MaliciousMD5)
```

# Used Tables

Sentinel and Defender For Endpoint can use different tables. In Defender For Endpoint, only tables within the MDE licence are used. In Sentinel more tables are used. If you do not have a table you can simply delete the section of that table and the query will run. The section below lists all tables that are used. 

## Sentinel
- DeviceNetworkEvents
- DeviceFileEvents

## Defender XDR
- DeviceNetworkEvents
- DeviceFileEvents

## Contributions

Contributions to this folder are appreciated! If you have a query which already uses a MISP feed which has not been implemented yet, then feel free to add it to the right folder. If you identify any errors in the queries please reach out, in order for them to be fixed. 

# Other implementations
There are other MISP implementations available for Sentinel, however, in those cases, it is needed to build additional infrastructure to retrieve the information. If you also want to share your information with MISP, then this is not the solution, the sources below also provide information if you want to contribute to MISP.
