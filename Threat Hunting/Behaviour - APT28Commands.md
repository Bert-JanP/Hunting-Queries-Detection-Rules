# APT28 Commands

## Query Information

#### Description
This KQL query can be used to hunt for APT 28 commands in your environment. The *threshold* can be used to adjust the amount of unique executed APT28 commands to be found within the defined *BinSize*, the *BinSize* is the timeframe in which the *threshold* needs to be reached. All the calculations are done for each device. The more APT28 commands are found on a device, the more likely it is that the device has been compromised. 

#### Risk
APT28 has gotten access to one of your devices and executes malicious payloads.
