#### Description
This detection rule focuses on identifying phishing emails that potentially use the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to host malicious content. The usage of IPFS in phishing campaigns is a sophisticated technique as it can bypass conventional security measures. The rule involves checking for subsequent connections to IPFS-hosted sites, which could indicate the execution of a phishing attack utilizing this decentralized file hosting system.

#### Risk
The risk targeted by this detection rule is the exploitation of IPFS in phishing campaigns, a method that could lead to successful phishing attacks due to the unconventional nature of IPFS as a hosting platform. Phishing attacks using IPFS can be more difficult to detect and can pose a significant threat to organizational security.
