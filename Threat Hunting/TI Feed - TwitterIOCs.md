# Twitter IOC feeds

## Description
This query uses tweets from the infosec community ([List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1423693426437001224)) as input. They have been combined into feeds in https://tweetfeed.live/. Those lists are used to search for IOCS in your environment. This query searches for the following IOC types:
- IP
- Domain
- URL
- MD5
- SHA256 

Some IOC categories that are included:
- CobaltStrike
- Ransomware
- AgentTesla
- Qakbot

The query used two input variables *TimeRange* to select the timerange to search in. The other variable is *IncludeSpamPhishingIPS* which by default filters phishing IPs because they are sensitive to false positives, this can be turned on if wanted.
The rest of the query looks for any IOC that matches if that is the case a row will be shown with that information, which tweet it originated from and which IOC category it has. Before any data is displayed the statistics of the dataset are shown to display what is included.
