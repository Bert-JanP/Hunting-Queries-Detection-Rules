## Query Information

#### MITRE ATT&CK Technique(s)

| Technique ID | Title    | Link    |
| ---  | --- | --- |
| T1566.001 | Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment | https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001/ |

#### Description
Adversaries may use executable files to gain initial access. A tactic that is used is to send executable files, when opening the files a script is directly run. This query detects a subset of the exectuble file extensions in Windows. The list can be increaded by appending additional extensions that you want to query. Some of those executable file extensions are already blocked by default in outlook, however administrators can change this behaviour.

#### Risk
An actor gains initial access via a attachment that is send to a mailbox, which someone has opened.
