#### Description
Adversaries can use LDAP to collect environment information. The query below can be used to detect anomalous amounts of LDAP queries from a originating device. This is done by baselining the normal amount of LDAP queries a device performs each hour. This query gives you input on which devices might need to be investigated.

Once you found a device you are interested in, simply use the [Find all the executed LDAP queries from a compromised device](../DFIR/Defender%20For%20Identity/MDI%20-%20LDAPQueriesByCompromisedDevice.md) with the devicename as input to list all the LDAP details. The LDAP queries that list al devices and/or all users are interesting when executed from a workstation.

The query uses a variety of different variables which determine the result.
- *starttime* - Determines the starting time of the search period
- *endtime* - Determines the end time of the search period
- *timeframe* - Determines the timeframe in which the amount of LDAP queries are counted. If you set this to 1 hour (1h) than a count for each hour is performed, if you set it to 1 day (1d) than a count for each day is performed and so on.
- *TotalEventsThreshold* - Determines that each device must at least have performed 1 LDAP query to be included.

Only workstations are included by default in this alert, if you also want to investigate servers, than remove the line as specified in the comments of the query.

#### Risk
An adversary has gained access to your network and performes LDAP queries to perform reconnaissance.
