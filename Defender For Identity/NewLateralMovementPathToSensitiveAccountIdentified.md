# Hunt for newly identified lateral movement paths to sensitive accounts

## Query Information

#### Description
Defender For Identity identifies lateral movement paths to all sensitive accounts (if possible). This is similar to a Bloodhound output. A newly identified path can mean that a sensitive account can be taken over if the path is followed.
